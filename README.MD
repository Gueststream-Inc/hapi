# HomeAway Payment Island API Wrapper #

This is a PHP library to make it easy to implement the HAPI HAT (HomeAway Payment Island Alternate Tokenization) service
provided by HomeAway to remove HomeAway and any other data or service provider from the PCI scope except the service
that is actively accepting credit card data from the guest.  More information can be found on the 
[HAPI Reference Page](https://beta.escapia.com/HAPI_Reference/index.html).
